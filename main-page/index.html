        About me,
        <br /> 
        My favourite band is 
        <a 
          href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0yhpelQ5TqFlhKSK7fEI0s?si=__sOTQiiQZaM1F9lLeJsNg">Baba
          Shrimps
        </a>
        
        and I can't stop listening to their music. Game wise i love
        how the portal series is structured including all the wonderful mods, on the
        other hand my true favourite game would be 
        <a
          href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/387990/Scrap_Mechanic/">scrap
          mechanic
        </a>.

        <br /> If you want to know where I am, just know I'm in
        your walls. My gamer tag is CageCell or Nokesko. Ah and one thing to add, my
        face will stay hidden. (If you find my face anywhere please let me know). I aim
        to reserve my gamer tag so no one can take it for them self.

        <br /> Currently im playing Silk Song. It's hard yes, but still really fun.

        I like to mess around with things like tweaking apps,
        <br />
        In the side bar you already might of seen my Sideloading Docs. 
        There i have a all you need to know wiki on iOS Sideloading. 
        <br /> I also have some github repos you can check out, 
        they are mostly forks of other repos.

        Interesting would alse be to talk about what games ive played in the past years.
        <br /> When it comes to factory games, I played Satisfactory and some shapez 2.
        Either from that not all to much, but waht i did play a bunch of was Scrap Mechanic.
        Man I really hope Chapter two comes out. Its been in development for so long now.
        <br /> Currently im playing Silk Song AND Hollow Knight at the same time.
        My friend refered to it as me getting hit in the face with a brick.
        yk because of the lore and stuff. I really like the game tho.
        <br /> Anyway, I own BeemNG Drive. 
        Probably not the best idea if i want to drive a car in the future.
        I almost forgot, Ghost of Tsushima is a really beautiful game.
